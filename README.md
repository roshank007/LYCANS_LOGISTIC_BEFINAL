<h1>  Lycans-Logistics </h1>

Lycans logistics is a BlockChain and IOT powered supply chain management system which provides control of the supply to only the participants involved in the process.

Me and my partners made this project as final project of our Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology at  <a href="https://www.svitvasad.ac.in/" target="_blank">Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute Of Technology.</a>


## Getting Started

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```shell
git clone https://github.com/roshank007/LYCANS_LOGISTIC_BEFINAL.git
cd my-proj
```


### Prerequisites

Angular CLI:

**Verify `ng -v`**

**Install `npm install -g @angular/cli`**

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.

### Installing

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
```

>Doesn't work in _Bash for Windows_ which does not support servers as of January, 2017.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

You're ready to write your application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
