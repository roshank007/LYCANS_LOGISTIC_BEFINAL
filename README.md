# Lycans-logistics
Lycans logistics is a BlockChain and IOT powered supply chain management system which provides control of the supply to only the participants involved in the process. 

## Getting Started

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```shell
git clone https://github.com/RajARROW/Lycans-logistics.git
cd my-proj
```


### Prerequisites

Angular CLI:

**Verify `ng -v`**

**Install `npm install -g @angular/cli`**

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.

### Installing

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
```

>Doesn't work in _Bash for Windows_ which does not support servers as of January, 2017.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

You're ready to write your application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
